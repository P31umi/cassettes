# cassettes.

An audio streaming web app built for The new's messages.

This is the site that runs [URL](#) â€” go there to listen to it!

This site is built on React and Next.js

## Requirements
- Node 8.1.2 or higher

## Development

First you `npm install`

Then you `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:6969`.


If you want to build your own version, just run `npm run build` and then I'd recommend deploying with `now`.

## shows Guidlines
- The shows are in markdown format, you can just follow formats of the former ones and edit them accordingly. You can read up on markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- The shows must must be numbered appropriately, because the web app views the shows chronologically, please take note.
- The dates in the show are in milliseconds, you can easily convert the date to millisecond [here](https://www.epochconverter.com/)
- After editing the show, ```git push``` to the repo, it auto deploys, so please wait for about 5 to 10 minutes before checking to see if it's up. After confirming it's up please go though the whole thing to make sure there are no mistakes. Please [contact](http://t.me/p31umi) me if there's an issue.
